# PostnatalMouseHypothalamus_SingleCellTranscriptome
This repository includes the codes used for  the analysis of the postnatal hypothalamus of CRH-IRES-Cre mice that were sequenced using single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), by employing a retrograde Connect-seq approach. We investigate the properties of the hypothalamus neural stem cells and offers an integrated reference dataset for validation. We further uploaded the processed files at figshare "https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21981251.v1". 

Highlights:
A comprehensive snRNA-seq dataset derived from the postnatal hypothalamus of CRH-Cre mice.
Technical validation of the Connect-seq dataset leveraging an integrated reference dataset.
The integrated reference dataset comprises 296,282 cells from postnatal hypothalamic regions and the adjacent BNST.
Identification of 30 unique hypothalamic neuronal and non-neuronal cell populations.
Harmonized cell-level metadata, offering insights into cell type-specific gene expression and cellular differentiation trajectories.

Objective:
The primary goal of this repository is to provide a robust resource for researchers investigating the gene expression patterns specific to cell types and pathways of cellular differentiation in the postnatal mouse hypothalamus. Furthermore, it offers a validation platform for the Connect-seq dataset using an expansive integrated dataset.

# PostnatalMouseHypothalamus_SingleCellTranscriptome
This repository includes data sets and related analysis for the postnatal hypothalamus of CRH-IRES-Cre mice that were sequenced using single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq). By employing a retrograde Connect-seq approach, We investigate the properties of the hypothalamus neural stem cells and offers integrated reference dataset for validation
